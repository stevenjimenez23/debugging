    <h1>Debugging: Problem 4</h1>
    <p>Use the errors you see in Google Chrome's JavaScript console to fix the bugs in the code and make it work. To open the console, hit Ctrl + Shift + J.</p>

        <p>In problem4.js, we tried to create two shapes in JavaScript and add them to an SVG canvas below. But neither of them are showing up! Look at the error messages you see and fix the code in problem4.js so the shapes show up. When you get this working, you should see two shapes below: a circle and a rectangle.</p>
